Overview

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of JavaScript-based Web3 wallet drainer kits, with a primary focus on the widely documented Angel Drainer, as well as references to Inferno Drainer and Monkey Drainer.

The goal of this analysis is to demystify the inner workings of these malicious kits — from wallet connection to asset draining — and highlight their sophisticated evasion and obfuscation techniques.
