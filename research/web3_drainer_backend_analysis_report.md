# Comprehensive Analysis of EVM Wallet Drainer Backend Infrastructure

## Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the backend infrastructure typically employed by real-world EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) wallet drainer kits like Inferno Drainer, Angel Drainer, Monkey Drainer, and similar variants. The focus is on how these backends log wallet connections, track approval events, trigger and queue draining transactions, store victim metadata and asset information, and manage multiple wallets used for draining.

The analysis is based on publicly available security research, technical write-ups, and logical inferences about how such systems would be designed to operate effectively and maliciously.

## Key Areas of Backend Infrastructure

The backend of a wallet drainer kit serves as the command and control (C2) center for the phishing operation. Its primary functions include:

1.  **Victim Data Management**: Logging information about users who interact with the phishing frontend.
2.  **Asset Tracking**: Identifying and cataloging valuable assets in victims' wallets.
3.  **Approval Logging**: Recording instances where victims grant token or NFT approvals to attacker-controlled addresses.
4.  **Drainage Orchestration**: Managing the process of transferring stolen assets.
5.  **Configuration Management**: Providing settings and parameters to the frontend drainer scripts.
6.  **Operational Security**: Implementing measures to evade detection and manage attacker resources.

This report is structured to cover these aspects in detail, referencing the supporting documents created during this analysis.

## Detailed Analysis Documents

The following documents provide in-depth information on specific components of the drainer backend infrastructure:

1.  **Backend Tech Stack and Integration (`backend_tech_stack_and_integration.md`)**: This document outlines the common backend technologies (PHP, Node.js, Python) and how the frontend drainer scripts integrate with these backend servers, including API endpoint patterns and cloaking mechanisms.

2.  **Database Schemas and Logging (`database_schema_and_logging.md`)**: This document details typical database choices (MongoDB, SQL, flat files) and the data schemas used to log victim information, asset details, approval events, and draining transaction statuses.

3.  **Approval Tracking and Draining Logic (`approval_tracking_and_draining_code.md`)**: This document provides conceptual code examples (Node.js, PHP, Python) illustrating how backends receive approval notifications from the frontend and how draining logic (both frontend and backend-initiated) might be implemented.

4.  **Automation: Webhooks and Cron Jobs (`automation_webhooks_cron.md`)**: This document explains how automation, through cron jobs or webhook-like mechanisms, is used to periodically check for pending approvals and trigger the draining of assets, ensuring timely and efficient theft.

## Summary of Backend Operations

1.  **Initial Contact and Cloaking**: The backend often employs a "gate" script (e.g., `index.php`) to filter incoming traffic, serving benign content to bots or researchers and the malicious drainer page to potential victims.

2.  **Data Logging**: Once a victim connects their wallet, the frontend script sends data (wallet address, IP, assets) to backend API endpoints. This data is stored, typically in a database like MongoDB or using flat JSON/text files.

3.  **Approval Tracking**: When a victim approves a token (e.g., `approve` for ERC20, `setApprovalForAll` for NFTs), the frontend notifies a specific backend endpoint. The backend logs this approval, marking the assets as "ready to drain."

4.  **Draining Execution**: 
    *   **Frontend-Initiated**: The victim might be tricked into signing the actual transfer transaction immediately after approval.
    *   **Backend-Initiated**: More commonly, the backend uses the logged approval to initiate the `transferFrom` (or similar) calls. This can be done via automated scripts (cron jobs or daemons) that periodically scan the database for pending approvals. These scripts use an attacker-controlled wallet (the "spender" that received the approval) funded with gas to execute the transactions.

5.  **Asset Management**: Stolen assets are transferred to attacker-controlled wallets. The backend may manage a pool of receiving addresses, rotating them to avoid blacklisting and to consolidate funds.

6.  **Configuration**: The backend can serve dynamic configurations to the frontend, such as lists of target tokens, current receiving wallet addresses, and other operational parameters.

## Tech Stack Insights

*   **Server-Side Languages**: PHP, Node.js (with Express.js), and Python (with Flask/Django) are common due to their ease of use, extensive libraries for web development and blockchain interaction (e.g., Web3.js, ethers.js, Web3.py), and wide availability of hosting.
*   **Databases**: MongoDB is a popular choice for its flexible schema, especially with Node.js backends. SQL databases or even simple flat files are also used, depending on the sophistication of the kit.
*   **Automation**: Cron jobs are a staple for scheduling periodic tasks like checking for and processing pending drains. Worker daemons offer more continuous polling.

## Conclusion

The backend infrastructure of EVM wallet drainer kits is a critical component that enables attackers to manage their phishing campaigns, log victim data, track approvals, and automate the theft of cryptocurrency assets. While the specific implementations vary, the core principles involve robust data logging, event-driven communication with the frontend, and automated processes for executing malicious transactions. Understanding these backend mechanisms is vital for developing effective countermeasures and for security researchers investigating these illicit operations.
